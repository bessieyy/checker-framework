call.invalid.ui=Calling a method with %s effect from a context limited to %s effects.
annotations.conflicts=A method may only have one effect annotation from @UI, @AlwaysSafe, and @PolyUI.
override.effect.invalid=%s in %s cannot override %s in %s; a method override may only be @UI if it overrides an @UI method.
override.effect.invalid.polymorphic=%s in %s cannot override %s in %s; a method override may only be @PolyUIEffect if it overrides a @PolyUIEffect method.
override.effect.invalid.nonui=%s in %s cannot override %s in %s; a method override may only be @UI if it overrides an @UI method (overriding non-UI instantiation of supertype).
override.effect.warning.inheritance=%s in %s overrides a method with @UI effect (%s in %s) and another method with an @AlwaysSafe effect (%s in %s).  This is discouraged.
polymorphism.invalid=Only @PolyUIType types may have @PolyUIEffect methods.
inheritance.polymorphic.invalid=An effect-polymorphic type may only inherit from another effect-polymorphic type (%s extends/implements %s).
effects.redundant.uitype=This method is annotated @UIEffect, which is redundant because the enclosing type is @UIType.
